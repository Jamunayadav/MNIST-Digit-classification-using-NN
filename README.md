# MNIST-Digit-classification-using-NN
first we have collected the appropriate data for my particualar use case and the next one is to process the image data that i have resize all the images to a common dimension, then we have converted rgb images in to grayscale image so i can considered this rgb images as colored images and grayscale images as a black and white image which only one color channel so this is the image processing task which i have done and then i have split the data between train and test data so i can train my neural network with this training data and i have evaluate neural network with the test data so after training i have feed neural network to perform when i will give image it have to recognize.
